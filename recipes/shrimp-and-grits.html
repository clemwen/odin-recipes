    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>So, Mr. Tipton, how could it take you five minutes to cook your grits, when it takes the entire grit-eating world 20 minutes.</p>

    <p>I don't know. I'm a fast cook, I guess.</p>

    <p>I'm sorry, I was all the way over here. I couldn't hear you. Did you say you're a fast cook? That's it?! Are we to believe that boiling waters soaks into a grit faster in your kitchen than on any place on the face of the earth?!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Grits</li>

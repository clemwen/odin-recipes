    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This pizza dough is thin and crispy. Firm and easy to work with and maintains integrity when sliced up.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>High gluten bread flour</li>
        <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>EVOO</li>
        <li>Extra fine sea salt</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Water</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p> A stand mixer helps, but you can do this in a large mixing bowl.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Measure out all ingredients in grams.</li>
        <li>Add all of yeast, and ~1/4 of bread flour to cover it up.</li>
        <li>Add ~1/4 of water and mix briefly and let sit until bubbling.</li>
        <li>Add remaining flour and water. Add oil and sugar to water to avoid clumping and continue mixing.</li>
        <li>Add salt last and continue mixing until mixture becomes uniform and all flour has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Dough should become a singular, firm object, but not mixed much further to avoid overworking.</li>
        <li>Portion into desired weight and fold into spheres.</li>
        <li>Let proof in refrigerator for at least 48 hrs.</li>
      </ol>
